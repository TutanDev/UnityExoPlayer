Making a Unity native rendering plugin to use exoplayer inside unity

This is a work in proggres. It envolves a lot of research and tries.
In this project I try to make a KISS native android rendering plugin.
This topic seems to be very confusing when looking for information and many posts simply don't work.

This project is not meant to be used in production, it is just a lab to test different approaches.
There is not a real focus on the video player itself regarding media features, it is just a way of simulating
real life scenario with continuoous external rendering.
